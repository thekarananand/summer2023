Tech : GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS, Google Fonts

> NOTE : Instead of Learning Something New, I tries to Practice. But even practicing requires learn small but significant things.

# GOOGLE FONTS
We can import fonts from Google Fonts. Here's How to do it

1. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) & Find you favorite font.
2. Now, Click and Open that Fonts page and scroll down to the **Styles** Section.
3. Select the style you like.
4. On the **Selected Family** Section on right side, under the **Use on the web** section, find the HTML and CSS code to add that font.

# GITHUB PAGES
We can host static webpages by the help of GitHub pages. Here's How to do it
1. Go to the repo containing HTML & CSS
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages** and under Branch, select the branch and click on Save.
3. Your Deployment will be soon ready.
